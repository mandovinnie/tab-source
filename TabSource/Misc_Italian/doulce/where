Hi again Wayne.

When working through the manuscripts, I noticed that some vocal
intabulations seem to have been very popular and are therefore duplicated in
the different Ms:s.

I thought that it would perhaps be interesting for the lutenetters to
compare the different versions concerning ficta, age etc. Wold be
interesting to know what opinions/input/info the netters would have about
the different versions...

New Grove:

" [Sandrin] His chanson Doulce memoire, for example, was among the most
popular compositions of the entire century, to judge from the number of
times it was reprinted, arranged for instruments and parodied."

I have made minimal alterations only for obviously misplaced notes!

Pls. if you choose to post it, *don't mention me as the poster, either now
or later!*

Best regards

Göran
