Best wishes to the list for a happy and very musical 1997!

I have uploaded a big batch of tab source files into /pub/dropoff on
ftp.cs.dartmouth.edu. These are all by Robert Ballard. Please note, the
numbers in the file names (e.g., "cour05.tab") do not necessarily
coincide with the numbers in the CNRS edition (that is, "cour05.tab"
is not the same as Courante 5 in the book). This is the first of several
big uploads of 10-course music I will be doing in the near future.
