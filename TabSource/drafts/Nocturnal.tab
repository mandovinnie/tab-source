% Nocturnal op. 70
% RCA: LSC 2964 - B
% Duration: 19:49
% 
% Sleevenote:
% 
% Britten's Nocturnal, written at Aldeburgh in 1963, is one of
% a group of pieces reflecting the composer's preoccupation
% with sleep and the world of dreams. The work is a set of
% variations that instead of departing from a theme works
% toward it - No. 20 in Dowland's First Book of Songs or
% Ayres of Four Parts (1597).
% But the theme and its previous variations are incomplete.
% Each mood of night fancyings is characterized; the variations
% are marked Musingly, Very Agitated, Restless, Uneasy,
% Marchlike, Dreaming, and Gently Rocking, which leads into
% a Passacaglia based on the alto part of the original air.
% When this comes, it is like a calm resolution of all the busy
% invention that has whirled in our minds; but as we draw
% near the close of the tune, it thins out into a single line
% and fades into silence. We may suppose that with the song
% unfinished, oblivion and peace have intervened. 
% J. Warrack

% Lyrics:
% 
% 1
% Come, heavy Sleep the image of true Death;
% And close up these my weary weeping eyes:
% Whose spring of tears doth stop my vital breath,
% And tears my heart with Sorrow's sigh-swoll'n cries:
% Come and possess my tired thought-worn soul,
% That living dies, till thou on me be stole.
% 
% 2
% Come shadow of my end, and shape of rest,
% Allied to Death, child to his black-fac'd Night:
% Come thou and charm these rebels in my breast,
% Whose waking fancies do my mind affright.
% O come sweet Sleep, come or I die for ever:
% Come ere my last sleep comes or come never.
% 
% Lute part:
