These pieces are meant to be played with a tuning that 
was developed around 1630 and was popular for a while
before the d-minor tuning became the standard.

These pieces are written for a ten course lute, but I include the
eleventh course because some people may play on 11 courses.  This
is really baroque lute music.

this is the classic "sharp" tuning ..
