The files in this directory are ascii text, which is the
source format for my "tab" program.  You may either fetch
the c source code for tab in the directory above, or mail 
these files to the tab server, tab-serv@cs.dartmouth.edu
If you mail them you will get a PostScript file which you can 
print on any postscript printer, after you edit it.
You must edit the file to remove all the mail headers,
so the the very first characters in the file are:


%!PS-Adobe

then your printer will accept this as a PostScript file and
print it.
