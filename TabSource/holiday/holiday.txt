Just in time for the holiday season, I've posted a number of settings 
of traditional Jewish music to the dropoff area at the Dartmouth FTP 
site and notified Wayne, so they should turn up in the TAB files 
soon.  I've sent the following pieces (with their file names):

Oseh Shalom:          osh-shlm.tab
Mi Y'MaLel:           miymalel.tab
Mo'z Tzur:            moz-tzur.tab
Shalom Aleichem:      shlmalcm.tab
Shalom Rav:           shlm-rav.tab
Al Shelosha Devarim:  alshlsha.tab
Tree of Life:         tr-of-lf.tab
Oh Chanukah:          chanukah.tab
I'm working on some more.  I hope you enjoy them.  They are pretty 
straightforward settings.  They would certainly invite variations,
divisions, etc.
