Mudarra, vihuela and tablature 

	Alonso Mudarra was the 3rd of the known vihuelists with surviving publications. His Tres Libros de Musica en Cifras (1546) followed Milan's El Maestro (1535) and Narvaez' Seys Libros del Delfin de Musica (1538). 

Tablature orientation: Mudarra's tablature was "upside-down" (although I doubt that Alonso would agree.)  [and used numbers rather than letters].  His top-most line in the tablature staff represented the bass-most string on the vihuela. This modern [French] tablature has flip-flopped the original tablature staff; the top-most line here represents the treble-most string. 
Vihuela tuning: The nominal tuning for the vihuela is G c f a d' g'. The same intervals can be gotten on the guitar by tuning string 3 down a half-step to f#. 
Tempo: Mudarra used 3 different symbols to indicate tempo. They were placed at the beginning of the first tablature staff. A symbol which looks like a Greek phi means "apriesa" (quickly). A "C" (which looks like our common time symbol) means a middle tempo. A "C" with a vertical slash down the middle (which looks like our cut time symbol) means "despacio" (slowly). These symbols were [originally] written on Mudarra's 1st, 2nd or 3rd line. I don't know what the different locations imply. 
Held notes: A caret, or hat (^), above a fret number in Mudarra's tablature means to let the note ring as long as possible. I suggest writing in a concave-up tie starting below the fret number and open-ended to the right. 
Right-hand technique: In a few pieces, Mudarra gives instructions for the right hand. He writes "dedi" for a "dedillo" passage - the index finger alone plays by plucking up and down. "Dosde" is short for "de dos dedos", which means to play the passage with alternating thumb and index finger. In some instances it is not clear exactly which fret number Mudarra's instruction is aligned with - not that this is crucial. (Modern right-hand technique seems to work fine.) 
Ornamentation: Mudarra's tablature never showed any ornaments. 
Final measures: Mudarra always wrote a breve (1 breve = 2 whole notes) as the rhythm for the last measure. Note that this is twice the value of the other measures. 
Simplification: While evolution has generally been very good to us humans, it's pretty clear that it's been sabotaging our left hands over the last few centuries. In particular, the 4-finger "flying wedge" formation shown below must have been child's play in the 1500s and 1600s, judging by its ubiquity. For most modern guitar mortals, it's a sure-fire crash point. Suggestion: use a 3-finger formation and leave out the second note from the top. Hey, it sounds the same! (The first example is typical in the vihuela pieces, the second in guitar pieces.)

	In most other cases of hard chord formations, it is possible to pull a similar stunt: just eliminate an internal note which is an octave of the bass or treble note. There will be negligible loss of effect. 
Rhythm: All of Mudarra's rhythm values have been halved (with the exception of one piece where they were quartered.) This brings the rhythm values into line with what we are used to reading today. Also, if the rhythms weren't halved, the tablature would show hypnotizingly long passages of bare stems. A single beam would appear only where the tablature here shows 16th notes. 
	Because the rhythms have been halved, it can be confusing describing corrections that have been made. (There weren't many.) I always speak in terms of Mudarra's original, full-length rhythmic values, so you must make a mental conversion when looking at the modern tablature.
