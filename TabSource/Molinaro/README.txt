Attached is "Ballo detto il Conte Orlando" by Simone Molinaro,
in its original solo lute form and as a duet.  This piece was
used by Ottorino Respighi as the basis for the first movement
of his Ancient Airs and Dances, suite I.  An amateur musicologist
friend of mine located a photocopy of a manuscript in Italian tab,
which I entered into Fronimo and converted to French tab.

The solo is quite difficult, requiring some "interesting" stretches
that are beyond my abilities at present.  I play duets with several
people locally, so I split the piece into two parts.  What's amazing
to me, and a testament to Molinaro's musical talent, is that
both parts stand by themselves as musically interesting and
fun to play.

I've attached the following files:
