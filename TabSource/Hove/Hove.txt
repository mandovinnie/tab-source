Joachim van de Hove was born in Antwerpen (nowadays Belgium)
in 1570. His Delitiae Musicae from 1612 is an extensive
collection of lute pieces with compositions of his own and
from other contemporaries, like Dowland and Italian composers.
Especcially the long pieces at the beginning of the book are mostly
composed by Van den Hove himself and are at least as beautiful
as the compositions from Dowland!!
Apart from this work the book 'Florida' from 1601 and some 
preludes Delitiae Musicae is the most famous work. It contains
66 pages of music, mainly lute music, but also some vocal work.
All music is intended for an 7, 8 or 10 ch. renaissance lute, but can
also be played on guitar.
The tabbed pieces here are just a start. I hope to have time
to increase the volume of nice pieces in tab format.
